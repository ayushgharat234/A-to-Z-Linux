## 🛠️ Installing Linux

### 🐳 1. Using Docker to Run Ubuntu
Docker is a lightweight containerization platform, perfect for running Linux environments without affecting your host operating system.

#### 🚀 Steps to Install and Run `ubuntu:latest` in Docker:
1. **Install Docker**:
   - Follow the official guide for your platform: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. **Pull the latest Ubuntu image**:
   ```bash
   docker pull ubuntu:latest
   ```
3. **Run a container from the pulled image**:
   ```bash
   docker run -it ubuntu:latest
   ```
4. **Explore your Ubuntu Environment**:
    * You’ll be in a shell session inside the container. Use basic Linux commands to interact with it.
    ```bash
    root@container-id:/# ls
    root@container-id:/# apt update
    ```
5. **Exit the container when done**:
    ```bash
    exit
    ```

### 💾 2. Dual Booting Linux with Windows
Run Linux alongside Windows on your PC.

#### 📝 Steps:
1. Back Up Data: 🗂️ Secure your files in case of unexpected issues.
2. Create a Bootable USB:
    * Use Rufus or similar tools to flash a Linux ISO onto a USB drive.
3. Partition the Disk:
    * Shrink an existing partition in Windows to create space for Linux.
4. Boot from USB:
    * Restart your PC, enter the boot menu (usually via F12, Esc, or Del), and select the USB.
5. Install Linux:
    * Follow the installer prompts to set up Linux alongside Windows.
6. Configure Bootloader:
    * Ensure GRUB or another boot manager lets you select between Windows and Linux at startup.

### ☁️ 3. Cloud-Based Linux Environments
Cloud platforms allow you to run Linux on virtual machines without needing local installations.

#### 🌐 Popular Platforms:
1. AWS EC2:
    * Launch an Ubuntu instance using the AWS Management Console.
    * Connect via SSH:
    ```bash
    ssh -i /path/to/key.pem ubuntu@<instance-public-IP>
    ```
2. Google Cloud VM:
    * Create a virtual machine with the Ubuntu image.
    * Connect using the Google Cloud SDK:
    ```bash 
    gcloud compute ssh <instance-name>
    ```
